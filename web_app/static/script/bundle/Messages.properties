intro_title1 = Paolo Bufalini\&#39s notebook (1981-1991)
p_1 = Paolo Bufalini was a member of the Italian Communist Party and senator from 1963 to 1992. He was also a Latinist and translator of Horace. He wrote a notebook between 1981 and 1991, including 145 bound pages and 2 sheets. 
p_2 = The notebook includes excerpts that are strictly related to his cultural and social background (e.g. quotations, annotations, translations from latin, tales). Since the aim of the notebook is not to be publicly shared, his assumptions on the texts he studies are often implicit, so as the bibliographic references of texts he quotes.
p_3 = When Paolo Bufalini died, his heirs donated the notebook to the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna. Scholars transcribed his notes, and identified 196 quotations. Texts referenced in his notebook mainly belong to Italian and Latin literature (Dante, Manzoni, Petrarca, Carducci, Virgilio, Orazio, Tacito, Cicerone, Ennio, Marziale, etc.), and secondly to European authors (Flaubert, Hegel, Shakespeare, Mann, Yourcenar, etc.).
intro_title2 = The digital scholarly edition of the notebook
p_4 = The digital edition of Paolo Bufalini\&#39s notebook (1981-1991) is an ongoing project of the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna. The contribution of the digital edition is to highlight all the aspects underpinning Bufalini\&#39s network of citations, i.e., intertextuality and intratextuality. Bufalini\&#39s aim is to reason on the history of literature, interpreting influences between his beloved authors, and comparing their texts or ideas.
intro_title21 = The model of the digital edition
p_5 = The encoded transcription of the notebook is provided as a <a href="/static/bufalini_quaderno.xml">XML/TEI file</a>. Among the elements defined in the <a href="/static/quaderno.rnc">model for the markup</a>, it includes elements describing relations between quotations (tei:cit, tei:quote), bibliographic references (tei:bibl), and people (tei:persName).
p_6 = In the header of the XML file all the excerpts are uniquely identified and linked to VIAF and Worldcat authority files. Similarly, people (both authors and cited people) are linked to entities in VIAF and the Italian Dbpedia. Furthermore, all the witnessed relations (between texts and between people) are here identified (tei:relation). 
intro_title3 = The semantic edition
p_7 = In order to add value to the aforementioned network of relations and annotations, Semantic Web technologies have been used to realize this digital edition and create a bespoke application.
p_8 = The digital edition entirely relies on <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Open Data</a> and respects good practises in Semantic Web community, namely:
li_1 = Persistent URIs are used to identify resources (<a href="https://w3id.org">https://w3id.org</a> is the provider);
li_2 = Existing ontologies are used to organize the knowledge: SPAR Ontologies, Dublin Core, Open Annotation, HiCO, and Nanopublications
li_3 = Data is served by content negotiation and a SPARQL endpoint is provided to access data. A <a href="https://w3id.org/bufalinis-notebook/sparql">graphic interface</a> is provided to directly query against the triple store.
p_9 = The code of the web application is open source and is available on github. Both data and the code can be reused under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC-0</a> license. Images are released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a> license.
intro_title31 = The meta-model
p_10 = In order to overcome the verbose description of the context of each Bufalini\&#39s interpretation, and secondly the context of editors\&#39 interpretations on the former, we decided to use named graphs to store information about provenance of interpretations.
p_11 = The transformation from XML/TEI to RDF has been performed in two steps.
li_4 = All the assertions regarding the transcription of the notebook, such as annotations, citations, bibliographic references and cited people, are part of a main graph, i.e.,  https://w3id.org/bufalinis-notebook/edition/ 
li_5 = All the other assertions regarding relations between people (as long as Bufalini defines them), or between texts, are included in separated graphs
p_12 = <a href="http://nanopub.org/guidelines/working_draft/">Nanopublications</a> approach consists in publishing linked data along with provenance and publication information.
# image
p_13 = Any graph including assertions made by Bufalini (e.g. a relation between author A and author B) is linked to two other graphs. The first includes provenance information (e.g. Bufalini cites an excerpt of author C that agrees on the aforementioned relation between A and B). The second includes information about the publication of assertions in the context of the digital edition (e.g. the responsibility of the Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies of the University of Bologna). A fourth graph identifies the nanopublication and links the former graphs. 
p_14 = The following example, in trig notation, represent the influence between an excerpt of Lucretio\&#39s De Rerum Natura and Manzoni\&#39s Inni Sacri.
# snippet
p_15 = Such a strategy allows each single fact to be cited along with editors\&#39 interpretation on the studied text. Finally, an integrity key will be associated to nanopublications, so that a stable version of assertions part of the edition will always be available. 
intro_title32 = The graph of the edition
p_16 = The main graph includes 8K triples, mainly describing textual phenomena and bibliographic information.
p_17 = To represent excerpts, including annotations of both Bufalini\&#39s notes and quotations, the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation</a> model was used to distinguish a text from the editor\&#39s identification of the source (i.e., the annotation of a quotation). Some properties from Dublin Core Terms and the OWL2DL version of <a href="http://purl.org/spar/frbr">FRBR</a> provided by SPAR ontologies are used to link an excerpt to others (e.g., following and preceding, complements, translations) and to referenced people. Citations are defined by using terms from <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito">CiTO</a>. The following example, in N3 notation describes the aforementioned excerpt of Alessandro Manzoni\&#39s Il nome di Maria. 
# snippet
p_18 = Here below, in N3 notation, the bibliographic reference for the former excerpt.

intro_title33 = The graphs of interpretations
p_19 = Bufalini\&#39s interpretations on texts and authors are described by about 800 triples, i.e. 10% of the knowledge base. To represent complex information related to his interpretations we used <a href="http://purl.org/emmedi/hico">HiCO</a>, an extension of the PROV Ontology that enabled us to formalize information such as the source used by Bufalini to state something, the type of interpretation, the adopted criteria and references to other authors in agreement with him. Here an example in N3 notation describing how Bufalini stated that Lucretio influenced Manzoni\&#39s Il nome di Maria.
# snippet
p_20 = When another author is referenced to support Bufalini\&#39s thesis, CiTO properties are used to link two interpretation acts. 
p_21 = Such a way to describe interpretations enables us to formalize rules for defining an authoritative interpretation, e.g. providing textual evidences, or citing a secondary source in agreement. In general, when Bufalini notices a relation between texts he does not provide further evidences rather than highlighting a shared term or sentence between the two texts. When describing relations between ideas or persons, he often recalls other authors\&#39 excerpts to support his thesis. Thus, we are able to distinguish the influence of "tradition" in his studies, and the innovative, genuine discoveries of Bufalini on regards of the history of literature.
